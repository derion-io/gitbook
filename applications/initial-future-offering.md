# Initial Future Offering

Initial Future Offering (IFO) is an upgraded version of the Initial DEX Offering (IDO) process, where the token is also made available on a perpetual DEX for users to go long and short.

A typical IFO process is as follows:

1. The token developer provides the initial liquidity to a Spot DEX AMM, preferably Uniswap V3, and receives the LP token.
2. Instead of burning or locking the LP token, the LP is added to Derivable's perpetual pool, and the developer receives the Derivable's LP token in return.
3. The Derivable LP token can now be either burnt or locked, depending on the tokenomic design chosen by the token developer.
