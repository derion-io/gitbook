Uniswap solves the spot DEX problems. Derivable solves the perpetual futures DEX problems.

Perpetual and futures exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) have been struggling with position liquidation and counter-party risks, along with the complication of premium and funding rates pricing, as they depend on many independent factors, including price volatility, funding time, and market balance. Derivable introduces a novel asymptotic power curve that deleverages itself as it approaches the reserve limit. This curve allows the creation of an AMM for leveraged perpetual and future derivatives of any index value without the risks of liquidation or under-collateralization.
