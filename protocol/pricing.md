Asymptotic Power Curves is our innovative Pricing Curve design that makes the vision of Derion feasible in the first place. Thanks to the Asymptotic Power Curves, Derion is able to achieve:

* NO liquidation at all;
* Everlasting perpetual future market for all market circumstances;
* Infinite liquidity, even without liquidity providers;
* Liquidity elasticity: Impermanent loss and gain, with asymptotic behavior at infinity;
* Leverage elasticity: Leverage is automatically and continuously capped upon market state transitions and price volatility.
* Continuous interest rate: to compensate LPs and help them reduce the risk of impermanent loss
