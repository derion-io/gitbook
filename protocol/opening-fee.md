# Opening Fee

<mark style="color:yellow;">\[Unrecommended Feature]</mark>

If configured by the pool, an opening fee may be applied when users open LONG or SHORT positions to further protect the pool from MEV front-running bots.

In the majority of cases, [maturity.md](maturity.md "mention") is much preferable to the Opening Fee, as it allows genuine users to have zero-fee trading while still protecting the pool from MEV bots.
