# Trading Manual

Holding position in Power Perpetual is holding derivative tokens. E.g. $$ETH^4$$, $$BNB^2$$, $$BTC^{-8}$$

Trading or changing Power Perpetual positions is swapping/converting some derivative tokens to another. E.g. swapping from $$ETH^4$$ to $$ETH^8$$ is increasing exposure/leverage of the same position.

Opening a position (or increasing a position value) is swapping from non-derivative tokens (BNB, WBNB, BUSD, CAKE\_WBNB\_BUSD) to derivative tokens ($$BNB^2$$, $$BNB^{-4}$$).

Closing a position (or decreasing a position value) is swapping from derivative tokens to non-derivative tokens.
