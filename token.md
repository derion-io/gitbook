# Tokenomics

Tokens are distributed via retrospective airdrops and liquidity incentives.

The token supply is initially capped and continuously deflated using buyback-and-burn with [protocol fee](protocol/interest-and-fee.md) (real yield).

Distribution:

* Community: 60%
  * Retrospective Airdrops: 30%
  * Liquidity Incentives: 30%
* Team: 20% &#x20;
* Incubators and Advisors: 20%
