# Tokenomics

Tokens are distributed via retrospective airdrops and liquidity incentives.

The token supply is initially capped and continuously deflated by buying back from AMMs to burn using protocol fee (real yield).

Token distribution:

* Community: 60%
  * Retrospective Airdrops: 30%
  * Liquidity Incentives: 30%
* Team: 20% &#x20;
* Incubators and Advisors: 20%
