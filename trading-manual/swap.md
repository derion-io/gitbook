Tokens:

* Cake-LP is the LP token of PancakeSwap for the WBNB+BUSD pair. Cake-LP can be acquired from [pancakeswap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance/add/BNB/0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56). But you can always swap directly from WBNB or BUSD in the Swap interface.
* DDL-CP is the Collateral Provider token of the pool. Swapping from WBNB/BUSD/Cake-LP is providing collateral to the pool. Swapping from DDL-CP to Cake-LP is withdrawing collateral from the pool.
* BNB^x: Derivative Tokens for BNB powered of x.

Restriction:

* Cannot swap any token to WBNB or BUSD
* DDL-CP can only swap to CAKE-LP (removeLiquidity)
* Only WBNB, BUSD, or Cake-LP can swap to DDL-CP. (Not from BNB^x)

ERC20 and ERC1155 token approval for Derivableâ€™s Router is required.
