# EIP-6120

The Universal Token Router ([EIP-6120](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6120)) is used as the only interactive entry contract to interact with the Derivable protocol. Users only need to approve once for each of their tokens. Token approval can be completely avoided by using only Derivative pools with WETH as the reserve token.
