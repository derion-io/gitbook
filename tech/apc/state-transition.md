# State Transition

A pool is represented by a 3-tuple ⟨R,α,β⟩, and each user transaction is a state transition that changes the 3-tuple value.

State transition does not affect other users with the tokens they are holding.

State transition can change the curves which affect the effective leverage of their tokens.
