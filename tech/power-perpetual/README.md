# Power Perpetual

Power Perpetuals (PP) are the DDLâ€™s derivatives that track the target value of $${B\over Q}^P$$, where B/Q is the rate of any token pair that can be fetched from on-chain oracles, and P is any integer number.

The Power Perpetual allows token holders to leverage their exposure to both directions of the asset price movement. With positive P, token holders take the LONG position with a leverage rate approximately of P times, and negative P represents the SHORT position.

Power Perpetual token requires no position nor orderbook, which poses no liquidation risk since $${B\over Q}^P$$ can never go to zero as long as the B/Q is not zero. This advantage does come with some prices: Exposure Fee and Deleveraging Cap.
