# Funding Rate

Power Perpetual tokens are exposed to higher convexity without liquidation risk compared to traditional leverage perpetual. On the other hand, Collateral Providers are betting on market stability and take all the liquidation risks. To balance those interests, the Exposure Fee is constantly charged from perpetual tokens and paid to Collateral Providers for compensation.

The total Exposure Fee depends on the exposure risk of the perpetual value of the pool. The more balanced the market capitalization between LONG and SHORT tokens, the lower the fee. The higher the collateral ratio, the lower the fee.
