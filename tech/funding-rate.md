# Funding Rate

Unlike position-based perpetual exchanges, where the funding rate is used for LONG and SHORT to compensate each other, the funding rate in Derivable is used for both LONG and SHORT to compensate the LP. The balancing force between LONG and SHORT naturally happens when the curve deleverages itself as they reach the reserve limit.
