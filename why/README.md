# Why Derion?

At the end of the day, what matters the most to Derion is the experience of our users. At Derion, we put user experience at the utmost importance and focus only on the benefits our users receive whilst using our product. We believe that Derion provides some of the best features and benefits our users cannot find elsewhere.

Derion offers various exclusive benefits for traders as a perpetual AMM DEX: no liquidation, higher upside with less downside, infinite liquidity, low fees, highly secure, and a fully on-chain open market. Trading perpetuals on Derion should feel simple yet powerful.

For liquidity providers, Derion guarantees a more attractive yield than any other protocol. Our market is optimally capital-efficient, allowing liquidity providers to earn the highest passive income while requiring minimal risk and capital.

We also welcome other complicated market participants, such as market makers, capital ventures, or hedge funds, to participate in our product. It is our confident belief that our innovative technologies, as well as strategies, have myriads of use cases to be explored. Derion is always excited to work on new, creative ideas that can be forged into practical applications and solutions; therefore, retail users are not our only target audience but also institution-grade funds.
