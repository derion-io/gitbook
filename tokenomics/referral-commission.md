# Referral Commission

Referring your friends to earn DER, either from [liquidity-mining.md](liquidity-mining.md "mention") or [trader-incentive.md](trader-incentive.md "mention"), will also be rewarded with up to half (for direct referrer) and a quarter (for the second-level referrer) of their referred DER reward.

To earn the maximum referral incentive, the referrer needs to participate in [liquidity-mining.md](liquidity-mining.md "mention")themselves with at least half of the liquidity referred by them.

For example, Alice provided $1000 as LP in Derivable incentivized pools to earn 0.04 DER/day, whether she is referred by anyone or not.

If Alice is referred by Bob, Bob can earn up to 0.02 DER/day if he provided at least $500 as LP himself. However, if Bob only provided $200 as LP, his referral reward is only 0.008 DER/day. Furthermore, there is no limit to the number of friends, like Alice, that Bob can refer to maximize his referral commission.

If Bob is also referred by Charlie, Charlie can take up to half of Bob's commission if he provided at least $250 as LP.
