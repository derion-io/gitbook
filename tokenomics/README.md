# Tokenomics

DER is the governance token of the Derion protocol. The token supply is capped at 100,000 DER and is continuously deflated through a buyback-and-burn mechanism using protocol fees (real yield).

As described in [funding-rate.md](../protocol/funding-rate.md "mention"), 1/5 of all pool fees (interest and premium) are collected as the protocol fee. This fee will be autonomously used to buyback-and-burn DER tokens via public DEX(es), effectively distributing the protocol yield to DER holders.

In the first phase of the protocol, due to the limitation of token bridging between networks, each network will have its own sub-token with the exact same tokenomics and incentives (e.g., DER-ARB, DER-BSC, etc.). These tokens will later be merged based on their respective USD values.

Token Distribution:

* Community: 63%
  * Liquidity Mining: 28%
  * Trading Incentive: 14%
  * Referrer Commission: 21%
* Partnership and Growth: 28%
* Core Team: 9%
