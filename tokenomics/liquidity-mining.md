# Liquidity Mining

63% of the initial supply of DER is distributed to the community via Liquidity Mining, Trading Incentive, and Referrer . To participate in Liquidity Mining, you need to follow the following steps:

1. Open LP positions in one of the following pools to receive the ERC-1155 [derivative-tokens.md](../design/derivative-tokens.md "mention") for your LP:
   * Arbitrum ([rETH](https://rocketpool.net)): ETH/USDT, ARB/ETH, WBTC/ETH, LINK/ETH
   * BSC ([BNBx](https://www.staderlabs.com)): BNB/USDT, CAKE/BNB, BNX/USDT, DOGE/BNB
2. Lock these LP tokens into the Liquidity Mining contract and earn the DER [rewards.md](rewards.md "mention") along with LP [funding-rate.md](../protocol/funding-rate.md "mention") and the underlying yield from [rETH](https://rocketpool.net) and [BNBx](https://www.staderlabs.com).
