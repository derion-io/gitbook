# Tokenomics

No ICO. No IDO. Tokens are distributed via retrospective airdrops and liquidity mining.

The token supply is initially capped and continuously deflated by buying back from AMMs to burnt using protocol fee (real yield).

Token Distribution:

* Community: 60%
  * Retrospective Airdrop: 30%
  * Liquidity Mining: 30%
* Team: 20% &#x20;
* Investors and Advisors: 20%
