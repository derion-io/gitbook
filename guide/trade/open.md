Afterward, you can choose to either long or short on the right panel. You can select between several leverage levels (see [Liquidity Concentration](../../protocol/liquidity-concentration.md)).

* Net Value: The value of your position without applying leverage (net).
* Size: The total value of your position after applying leverage.

* Daily Interest Rate: The fees you must pay daily to maintain your position.
* Deleverage Risk: The risk of your position being auto-deleveraged. The larger the position, the higher the risk.
