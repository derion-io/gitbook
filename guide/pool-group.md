# Pool Group

Derivable pools with the same Reserve Token and Price Oracle are grouped together to form a multiple-leverages market. The Derivable interface will provide many tools for users to filter and choose which pool to participate in.

When users want to mint a token of an index price and leverage, they will be shown pools with different configs and states to choose from: Reserve Token, Min Expiration, Discount Rate, Total Locked Value, Risk Factor, Maximum Full Leverage Range, etc.
